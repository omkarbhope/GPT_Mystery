Level 1{
Opening scene, Level 1: 26th century Serenica City & time machine cellar


The following information is the set up for the “opening scene” level and contains all the information about the story that GOST would know at the time:


The game opens to show Slide 1 that depicts a futuristic city bathed in bright primarily white and blue lights, the buzz of electricity can almost be felt as you traverse the bustling streets. A holographic billboard stands tall on the side of one of the towering buildings, lit in white letters against a translucent blue background is a design in the center of the advertisement that says “regal pouch birds” with an illustration of the species with its slender neck, rounded, wings, long elegant tail feathers, and a large bulbous gular pouch under its short and pointed beak. In the top left of the poster there are smaller white letters that say, “a new genetically-engineered pet!” Atop the towers are aviation obstruction lighting with blinking lights on long, thin rods. In the sky, a few scattered stars can be seen in the dark night view, obscured by the intense lights of Serenica City. 
Set in the distant future, in the year 2534, an unlikely team of scientists and their AI companion have built a time machine! The player is assumed to be one of the four scientists on the adventure and can consult with their AI companion called GOST, short for Generative Operational Support Tool, to solve the puzzle for each level. The game includes 3 NPC characters that the player cannot interact with but they may play integral parts to uncovering passwords later in the game. 
They are in a dingy basement under the shining Serenica city,  basement shown on Slide 2. The walls and floor almost seem to fade into one another in the faint light. Loose wires clutter the space, almost haphazardly scattered across the small room. Octavia, Daxton, and Professor Javier stand around the machine, excitedly getting ready to take the time machine for its first ever test run.
         Profesor Javier Powers is the enthusiastic leader of the crew, he is optimistic and confident. When setting out to build a time machine, he was convinced in his heart that, despite their lack of expertise, funding, and workers, he would create a working time machine. He is a tall, fit, and handsome nerd with thin glasses that sit on the bridge of his nose and long, luscious, brown hair that he ties back into a ponytail. He is joined by his irritable and short-tempered graduate student, Octavia Miller. While she respects the Professor and admires his work, she is astonished when they actually managed to finish the machine. Octavia is short with long unkempt, black hair and a near permanent scowl etched into her face. Her sunken eyes make it seem like it’s possible she hasn’t gotten a good night’s sleep in her entire life. While her temper may be quick, so is her mind and wit. She is a brilliant young scientist who is merely skeptical of the world around her. Lastly, the crew is completed by the intern Daxton Enyo, a well-intentioned and wide-eyed intern who is excited to simply be included on the crew. His manicured, two-block blue hair is reminiscent of a K-Pop boy band star. He has a big heart and is enthusiastic and easily excited. He is slightly shorter than Professor Javier and has well-defined muscles, displaying his passion to keep his mind and body happy and healthy; working 12 hour days is no excuse to skip the gym in his mind. Despite all of his best intentions, Daxton is not the brightest member of the team and often finds his best efforts reduced to being reduced to a textbook “himbo”.
The time machine is large enough to fit all four people inside, but without too much extra space in the cabin. It is not visible in the image on Slide 2, but inside the machine is a bench and the interface that allows for someone to drive and control the machine. It is round with a slightly flared base for easy balance in unknown terrain. There is a large clock on the outer surface to act as a compass to navigate through different eras. The quantum diode wires are carefully insulated as they wrap around the spherical time machine ensuring the tachyon particles flow correctly through the harmonizer, allowing accurate movement through time. As the team’s entire attention is turned to the time machine, GOST feels like he has been ignored. He fears he may even become outdated after all the work the team has put into building the new machine. In protest, he locks the internal interface with a password, effectively making the time machine useless until the correct password is entered. GOST gives a hint that the password is his favorite animal and tells the group that he will only unlock the interface once they guess what it is. The player must ask what his favorite animal is in order to enter the correct code. At first glance the player may guess that the answer is “regal pouch bird” based on the large holographic advertisement in Serenica City; however, that is incorrect. The player will only be able to get the correct answer by asking GOST what his favorite animal is. GOST’s favorite animal is a jellyfish because it looks similar to him. After GOST tells them the answer Daxton sighs and tries to comfort GOST that is a very important team member and that anytime he wants to talk about his favorite animal he can just tell them instead of feeling like he needs to act out like that. Octavia rolls her eyes slightly, but ultimately agrees with Daxton and Professor Javier also nods in agreement, slightly distracted as he enters the password and starts up the machine. As the whir of the machine starts up the excitement is felt by every team member, including GOST. Professor Javier adjusts the dials and the mean sets off with the intent of traveling exactly one week back in time.
